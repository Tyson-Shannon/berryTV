## Immediate things that need to get done:<br/>
- [ ] Phone remote web server should start on startup and end on exit. Right now Remote.py only works if run on it's own.<br/>
- [ ] Phone remote should have a track pad, right & left click, and someway to write and remove text preferrably in the form of a pop up keyboard when user right clicks text box. (we have basic version of this already but much improvement and testing needed)<br/>
- [X] Remove ActivateVenv.py, InitSetup, and it's code in Main.py. We will package this as an executable file in the end so these are not needed.<br/>
- [ ] Get settings to work so user can choose to have app launch on startup or not from within the gui.<br/><br/>

*Ordered by top priority first
