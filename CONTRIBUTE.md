## Immediate things that need to get done:<br/>
- [X] Phone remote web server should start on startup and end on exit. Right now Remote.py only works if run on it's own.<br/>
- [X] Phone remote should have a track pad.<br/>
- [ ] Phone remote should be able to enter and edit text.<br/>
- [ ] Get settings to work so user can choose to have app launch on startup or not from within the gui.<br/><br/>

*Ordered by top priority first
