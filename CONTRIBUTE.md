Things that need to get done
-Phone remote via local webserver. It should have a track pad, right & left click, and someway to write and remove text preferrably in the form of a pop up keyboard when user right clicks text box.
-remove activatevenv, initsetup, and it's code in Main. We will package this as an executable file in the end so this is not needed
-get settings to work so user can choose to have app launch on startup or not from within the gui
