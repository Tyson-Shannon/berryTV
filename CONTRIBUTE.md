## Things that need to get done:<br/>
- [ ] Phone remote via local webserver. It should have a track pad, right & left click, and someway to write and remove text preferrably in the form of a pop up keyboard when user right clicks text box. (working on)<br/>
- [ ] Remove activatevenv, initsetup, and it's code in Main. We will package this as an executable file in the end so this is not needed.<br/>
- [ ] Get settings to work so user can choose to have app launch on startup or not from within the gui.<br/><br/>

*Ordered by top priority first
